# Agent Chat UI Development Strategy for Encore Pro AI

## üéØ Goal

Use Agent Chat UI as the primary frontend during development of Encore Pro AI to:

* Accelerate orchestration and capability testing
* Visualize agent reasoning, tool calls, and task traces
* Avoid premature UX investment while back-end logic evolves

## ‚úÖ Why Agent Chat UI is the Right Choice (Now)

| Benefit                          | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Native LangGraph Integration** | Directly supports LangGraph planner/task orchestration, tool calls, and streamed agent output.          |
| **Reasoning and Trace Display**  | Built-in support for showing reasoning blocks, tool invocation traces, and agent decision chains.       |
| **Zero Frontend Work to Start**  | Enables immediate testing of orchestration pipelines without needing to build a custom UI.              |
| **Modular for Tenant Testing**   | Can be deployed per tenant or user role to test different capability availability and state patterns.   |
| **Supports Streaming**           | Works natively with SSE or WebSocket output, perfect for real-time LLM feedback and progressive output. |

## üß™ Dev Workflow with Agent Chat UI

1. **Build Orchestration Pipeline**

   * Use `describe()` on capabilities for dynamic context injection
   * Route to relevant nodes using PlannerAgent

2. **Run Agent Chat UI Locally**

   * Connect to FastAPI backend (or LangServe)
   * Wire SSE or POST-based `/chat` or `/agent` endpoint

3. **Test Real Tenant Flows**

   * Inject real `AgentState` and `CoreState` objects
   * Use `test_dynamic_capabilities.py` and Docker to run orchestrations

4. **Observe Trace and Reasoning**

   * Watch how capabilities are selected
   * Verify reasoning summary and structured outputs
   * Adjust describe() metadata if logic needs tuning

5. **Tune Capabilities + Orchestration**

   * Add planner hints or reasoning improvements
   * Test memory and tool output formatting end-to-end

## üß± Migration Path to End-User UI

| Future UI                      | Migration Complexity | Strategy                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chatbot UI**                 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium            | Flatten orchestration trace and reformat structured output blocks |
| **Custom React App**           | ‚úÖ Easy               | Reuse backend logic, tool renderers, and output schemas           |
| **Mobile UX or Embedded Chat** | ‚úÖ Easy               | Build against message schema and streaming endpoints              |

**Key Tip:** Keep rendering logic modular and avoid hardcoding UI-specific assumptions in your agent responses.

---

## üß† Final Recommendation

> Use **Agent Chat UI as your internal development and debugging interface**.
>
> * You‚Äôll accelerate agent development, capability validation, and planner tuning.
> * Once the backend is stable, you can swap in a branded UI (Chatbot UI or custom) without breaking logic.

This is the fastest, most flexible path to get Encore Pro AI from orchestration to production.

## üîÅ Recommendation for Transferable Architecture

To ensure a smooth migration path to a custom or branded UI, build with these principles:

* **Message Payload Contracts**:

  * Define a structured schema for message types: `agent_response`, `tool_output`, `reasoning`, `trace_step`
  * Ensure all tool outputs and agent decisions are tagged with `type` and `payload`

* **Modular Renderers**:

  * Keep UI renderers for reasoning, trace, and output decoupled from chat logic
  * Create reusable components like `<ReasoningCard />`, `<InsightTable />`, `<ToolOutputBlock />`

* **Orchestration-UI Boundary**:

  * Ensure that no UI-specific formatting logic leaks into your planner or capability `describe()` methods
  * Use intermediate response objects that any UI (Agent Chat, Chatbot UI, mobile app) can interpret

* **Streaming Consistency**:

  * Standardize your streaming format (SSE or WS) with message boundaries that are UI-agnostic

* **Theme & Branding Isolation**:

  * Keep styles and themes in separate layer if modifying Agent Chat UI so you can port the logic but rebrand elsewhere

By following these principles, you ensure that Agent Chat UI remains your **dev scaffold**, while your production UX can evolve independently without rewriting backend or orchestration code.

## üõ† Next Steps

* [ ] Fork and theme Agent Chat UI for Encore Pro
* [ ] Wire to FastAPI or LangGraph `/chat` endpoint
* [ ] Enable reasoning block display and task trace rendering
* [ ] Create fallback renderer for tool output previews
* [ ] Begin testing orchestration with real tenant data
