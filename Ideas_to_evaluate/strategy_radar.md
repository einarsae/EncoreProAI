## ‚úÖ Already Live / Production-Ready

| Capability                            | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Per-Customer Embedding**            | Each customer has a 1536-dim semantic vector summarizing behavior, tags, preferences. Supports similarity search and clustering.     |
| **Tag-Based Segmentation**            | Customers are dynamically tagged (e.g., `major_donor`, `opera_fan`, `lapsed_donor`) and used in queries, campaigns, and logic flows. |
| **Vector Search with pgvector**       | Cosine similarity search directly inside Postgres to find "customers like X" or match to event archetypes.                           |
| **Batch Embedding Pipeline**          | Customers re-embedded efficiently in batches on behavioral or tag change. Managed via cron or ETL job.                               |
| **Tag-Driven Agent Query Resolution** | Agents resolve natural language requests into SQL using tags as DSL anchors (e.g., "high-value lapsed donor").                       |
| **Customer Summary Generation**       | Profile summaries used as embedding input: combines tags, genres, behavior, and time.                                                |

| **Clarifying Planner Nodes**         | Agents that ask clarifying questions, infer context, and generate structured queries.                     |
| **Insight Extraction Agents**        | LLM-powered reasoning over sales data (e.g., "Why are these events underperforming?").                    |
| **Weekly Audience Monitoring**       | Agents generate and send reports (e.g., customers with accessibility needs this week).                    |
| **Segment-Centric Vector Averaging** | Average top donor embeddings to find similar prospects (centroid-based lookalike modeling).               |
| **Dynamic Knowledge Graphs**         | Customer ‚Üí tag ‚Üí genre relationships modeled for influence and similarity detection.                      |

| **Self-Healing Embeddings**                    | Adjust vectors based on live response data (e.g., opens, purchases, clicks). Embeddings evolve with behavior.                                   |
| **Auto-Segmentation via Clustering**           | Use HDBSCAN or k-means on vectors to discover emergent segments and label them semantically.                                                    |
| **Campaign Simulation Agents**                 | LLM simulates campaign outcomes based on cohort behavior and response history.                                                                  |
| **Long-Term Agent Memory**                     | Track customer journey stages (e.g., donor ‚Üí lapsed ‚Üí recaptured) and forecast transitions.                                                     |
