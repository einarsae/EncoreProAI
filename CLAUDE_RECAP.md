# Claude Recap - EncoreProAI Implementation

## Current Status: Day 4 - Orchestration & Capabilities

### What We've Built So Far

#### Day 1: Foundation (✅ COMPLETED)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector and pg_trgm extensions
- Entity population from Cube.js with disambiguation data
- CubeService with JWT authentication
- EntityResolver with trigram similarity search and cross-type fallback
- Comprehensive test suite

#### Day 2: Frame Extraction (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Simplified Frame Model**: Removed times field, keeping only entities and concepts
- Frame extraction identifies entities (productions, venues, etc.) and concepts (revenue, trends, analysis)
- Multi-turn conversation support
- Tests passing with 92.3% success rate

#### Day 3: ChatCapability (✅ COMPLETED)
- Emotional support for theater professionals
- Uses Claude Sonnet (via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Concise responses (2-3 sentences)
- User context support (future enhancement)

#### Day 4: Orchestration (🚧 IN PROGRESS)
- LangGraph workflow implemented
- Frame-based routing (extract → resolve → orchestrate → execute → loop)
- Single-task execution with continuous replanning
- ✅ TicketingDataCapability implemented as pure data fetcher
- ❌ EventAnalysisCapability still needs implementation

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Frame Simplification
User feedback: "why are we including time in concepts. I see no benefit?"
- Removed `times` field from Frame model
- Now only extracts: entities, concepts
- Added specific concepts: analysis, automation, segmentation

#### 2. Capability Architecture
```
TicketingDataCapability (✅ DONE)
├── Pure data fetcher - no analysis
├── Wraps CubeService for orchestrator
├── Returns raw DataPoint objects
└── Uses correct field names (ticket_line_items.amount)

EventAnalysisCapability (❌ TODO)
├── Intelligent analyzer
├── Takes raw data from TicketingDataCapability
├── Can request more data progressively
└── Returns insights, trends, recommendations
```

#### 3. Progressive Analysis Pattern
User confirmed: "Perfect!" to this approach:
- EventAnalysis can request data multiple times
- Can batch multiple data requests in one call
- Orchestrator handles the routing between capabilities
- Example flow: Chat → TicketingData → EventAnalysis → TicketingData → EventAnalysis → Complete

### Important Implementation Details

#### Environment Variables
Docker-compose maps these:
- `CUBE_API_URL` (from .env) → `CUBE_URL` (in container)
- `CUBE_API_SECRET` (from .env) → `CUBE_SECRET` (in container)
- Also needs: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`

#### Entity Resolution
- Primary type resolution first
- Falls back to cross-type lookup if score < 0.5
- Disambiguation includes: ID, dates, recent sales

#### Database Field Names
- Use `ticket_line_items.amount` NOT "revenue"
- Use `ticket_line_items.quantity` for attendance
- Productions: Gatsby, Chicago, Wicked (NOT Hamilton)

### What's Working Now

1. **Frame Extraction**: 
   - Query: "Show me revenue for Gatsby. How are you feeling?"
   - Extracts: entities=[Gatsby/production], concepts=[revenue, emotional_state]

2. **Entity Resolution**:
   - Resolves "Gatsby" → "THE GREAT GATSBY [p123] (2024-present) $1.2M last 30 days"
   - Cross-type fallback for ambiguous terms

3. **Chat Capability**:
   - Handles emotional queries with empathy
   - Keeps responses concise (2-3 sentences)

4. **TicketingData Capability**:
   - Fetches raw metrics from Cube.js
   - No analysis, just data retrieval

### Next Steps (TODO)

#### 1. Implement EventAnalysisCapability
```python
class EventAnalysisCapability(BaseCapability):
    """
    Intelligent analysis of ticketing data
    - Takes raw data from TicketingDataCapability
    - Identifies trends, patterns, anomalies
    - Can request additional data as needed
    - Returns insights and recommendations
    """
```

#### 2. Test Full Orchestration Flow
- Query: "I'm worried about Chicago. How is it performing?"
- Should trigger: Chat → TicketingData → EventAnalysis → Response

#### 3. Handle Multi-Frame Queries
- Current: Only processes one frame at a time
- Need: Process multiple frames in sequence

#### 4. User Profile Management
- Store UserContext persistently
- Track preferences across sessions
- Multi-tenant support

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test individual components
docker-compose run --rm test python test_ticketing_data.py
docker-compose run --rm test python demo_ticketing_capability.py

# Test orchestration
docker-compose run --rm test python test_orchestrator_with_data.py

# Run all tests
docker-compose run --rm test python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Verify setup
docker-compose run --rm test python verify_ticketing_setup.py
```

### Key User Feedback Incorporated

1. **No time extraction**: "I see no benefit"
2. **Correct field names**: "use 'amount' not 'revenue'"
3. **Correct show names**: "use Gatsby instead" (not Hamilton)
4. **Progressive analysis**: "Can the event analyzer make more data requests?"
5. **Response length**: "too long", "keep it to 2-3 sentences"
6. **No mocks**: "I am only interested in running real test"

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Task Tracking**: Store task in message metadata, not state field
2. **Entity Fallback**: Must explicitly call cross_type_lookup
3. **Docker Env Vars**: Must be listed in docker-compose.yml
4. **Capability Routing**: Orchestrator routes to `execute_{capability_name}`
5. **Single Task Execution**: One task at a time, see results before next

## Ready to Continue!

When you return, the immediate next step is implementing EventAnalysisCapability. The TicketingDataCapability is complete and tested, providing the raw data foundation that EventAnalysis will interpret intelligently.
