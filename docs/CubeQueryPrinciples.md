# Cube Query Generation Principles & Capabilities

## 1. Guiding Principles

- **Deterministic, Schema-Driven Translation:**
  - All natural language queries are mapped to Cube.js queries using a dynamic, tenant-aware schema summary and field mapping table.
  - The LLM acts as a deterministic translator, not a guesserâ€”only fields present in the schema summary and mapping table are allowed.
- **Tenant-Specific Relevance:**
  - Only cubes, measures, and dimensions relevant to the current tenant are exposed via JWT authentication.
  - Our CubeService handles JWT token generation with tenant isolation.
- **Concept Model Alignment:**
  - User/LLM phrases are mapped to Cube fields using our ConceptResolver service.
  - EntityResolver handles disambiguation of entity names using trigram similarity search.
  - TimeResolver parses natural language time expressions to Cube.js date ranges.
- **Frame-Based Understanding:**
  - Queries are understood through semantic frames that capture intent, entities, and relationships.
  - The orchestrator uses these principles when constructing Cube.js queries.
- **Comprehensive Feature Utilization:**
  - All advanced Cube.js features (compareDateRange, nested filters, drilldowns, etc.) are supported.
- **Robust Error Handling:**
  - All LLM output is post-processed and validated against the schema; invalid or ambiguous output triggers clarification or fallback.

## 2. Cube.js Capabilities Leveraged

- **Measures & Dimensions:**
  - Aggregations (sum, avg, min, max, count) on all available measures.
  - Grouping and slicing by any dimension.
- **Filters:**
  - WHERE-style and HAVING-style filters on dimensions and measures (all in the 'filters' array).
  - Support for all Cube.js operators (equals, notEquals, in, notIn, contains, notContains, startsWith, endsWith, set, notSet, gt, gte, lt, lte, inDateRange, notInDateRange, beforeDate, afterDate).
- **Logical Operators:**
  - AND, OR, and nested logic for complex filter conditions.
- **Time Dimensions & Granularity:**
  - Time series queries with day/week/month/quarter/year granularity.
- **Ordering & Limiting:**
  - Top N, bottom N, custom ordering, and pagination.
- **Compare Date Ranges:**
  - 'compareDateRange' for side-by-side period comparisons (e.g., YOY, MOM).
- **Drilldowns & Data Blending:**
  - Multi-cube joins, drilldown, and cross-dimensional analysis (where supported).
- **Ungrouped Queries:**
  - Raw row output for debugging, exports, or audit trails.

## 3. Domain Support, Concept Models, and Tenant Config

- **ConceptResolver Service:**
  - Maps user/LLM phrases to Cube field names (measures, dimensions, filters).
  - Uses cached concept mappings for common terms and LLM for ambiguous cases.
  - Handles normalization, aliasing, and value canonicalization.
- **EntityResolver Service:**
  - Resolves entity names to IDs using PostgreSQL trigram similarity search.
  - Provides disambiguation strings for productions with dates, revenue, and sold_last_30_days.
  - Supports cross-type entity lookup with score discounting.
  - Handles both real entities (productions, venues, customers) and fake entities (city, country, state, currency).
- **TimeResolver Service:**
  - Parses natural language time expressions to Cube.js date ranges.
  - Caches common patterns and uses LLM for complex expressions.
- **Tenant-Specific Config:**
  - JWT tokens include tenant_id for Cube.js data isolation.
  - All services respect tenant boundaries for data access.

## 4. Prompt Structure & Best Practices

- **Dynamic Schema Summary:**
  - Inject a token-efficient, tenant-aware schema summary into the prompt.
- **Field Mapping Table:**
  - Show user/LLM phrases mapped to Cube field names for deterministic translation.
- **Supported Query Types & Examples:**
  - Provide JSON examples for all major query types (aggregation, multi-measure, filters, time series, grouping, top N, compare ranges, nested filters, etc.).
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Document and show examples for compareDateRange, nested AND/OR/NOT, drilldown, and data blending.
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
  - Never invent field names; always use canonical IDs/names; never use null/undefined for required fields.
- **Output Format Instructions:**
  - Output a single JSON object compatible with Cube's query schema, using only required keys.

---

## 5. Planner Post-Processing & Validation

- **Field Mapping:**
  - All LLM output is mapped to Cube fields using the field mapping table and schema summary.
- **Schema Validation:**
  - All measures, dimensions, and filters are validated against the loaded schema before query execution.
- **Value Normalization:**
  - Filter values are canonicalized (e.g., entity names/IDs uppercased or mapped as required).
- **Advanced Feature Support:**
  - Planner supports all advanced Cube features, including compareDateRange and nested filters.
- **Clarification Handling:**
  - If output is ambiguous or invalid, set `needs_clarification: true` and provide a `clarification_hint`.

### **C. Tips & Tricks**

- **All filter logic (including HAVING/post-aggregation) goes in the 'filters' array.**
- **Filters are ALWAYS an array, not an object (per our CubeService implementation).**
- **Use nested AND/OR/NOT for complex cohort/segment logic.**
- **Use 'set'/'notSet' for null checks.**
- **Use 'inDateRange', 'beforeDate', 'afterDate' for time filtering.**
- **For Top N, use 'order' + 'limit'.**
- **For distinct lists, use only 'dimensions'.**
- **For raw data, omit measures/dimensions.**
- **For multi-step plans, use output of one query as filter in the next.**
- **Always use canonical field names and values.**
- **Validate all fields and values before query execution.**
