# EncoreProAI - Current Implementation State

## Overview
This document reflects the ACTUAL current state of the EncoreProAI project as of the latest implementation. It serves as the source of truth for what is working, what's in progress, and what remains to be done.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. **TicketingDataCapability** (Production Ready)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ALL 9/9 features fully operational
- **Capabilities**:
  - LLM-driven query generation using ALL Cube.js features
  - Multi-fetch strategy for time comparisons (Q1 vs Q2, etc.)
  - Pagination with offset/limit and total count
  - Hierarchical data exploration (multiple dimensions)
  - High cardinality dimension handling with automatic limits
  - Natural language understanding ("revenue" ‚Üí ticket_line_items.amount)
  - Complex filters including nested AND/OR logic
  - Time intelligence with granularity selection
- **Recent Updates**:
  - Fixed: Multi-fetch granularity issue resolved
  - Cleaned: Removed 179 lines of unused code (21% reduction)
  - Simplified: Removed unused methods and classes
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite in `/tests/ticketing/` - all tests passing

### 2. **Core Services** (Stable)
- **CubeService**: Direct HTTP client with JWT authentication
  - Timeout handling (30s)
  - Tenant isolation
  - All Cube.js query features supported
- **EntityResolver**: PostgreSQL-based entity resolution
  - Trigram similarity search
  - Ambiguity preservation
  - Score transformation for better ranking
- **ConceptResolver**: Pattern-based with mem0 learning
  - Base patterns for common concepts
  - Memory integration for learned patterns
  - Fallback to LLM for ambiguous cases
- **CubeMetaService**: Schema introspection
  - Gets available measures and dimensions
  - Validates field names

### 3. **Docker Infrastructure** (Working)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Test runner service with all environment variables
- Health checks and proper dependencies
- Volume mounting for development

### 4. **Models & Data Structures** (Complete)
- Pydantic v2 models for all data types
- Proper state management structures
- Frame-based semantic understanding
- Capability input/output models

## üöß In Progress

### 1. **EventAnalysisCapability**
- **Status**: Code exists but needs ID-based filtering
- **Issue**: Not properly using resolved entity IDs
- **Required**: Integration with orchestrator
- **Priority**: HIGH - This is the next critical component

### 2. **Orchestration Workflow**
- **Status**: LangGraph structure implemented
- **Issue**: Not all capabilities registered/tested
- **Required**: Full integration testing with real data

### 3. **ChatCapability**
- **Status**: Implementation exists
- **Issue**: Not fully tested with orchestrator
- **Required**: Emotional context detection and response generation

## ‚ùå Not Implemented

### 1. **Memory Service Full Features**
- Entity disambiguation pattern tracking
- Query pattern recognition and success tracking
- User preference learning
- Contradiction resolution

### 2. **Multi-Frame Query Handling**
- Currently processes one frame at a time
- No support for complex multi-part queries

### 3. **Production Features**
- No caching (schema or query results)
- No retry logic for transient failures
- No rate limiting for Cube.js protection
- Basic monitoring only

## üìä Test Status

### Passing Tests
- `test_all_features.py`: 8/9 features (multi-fetch failing)
- Entity resolution tests
- Basic Cube.js query tests
- Model validation tests

### Failing/Timing Out Tests
- Many integration tests timeout
- EventAnalysisCapability tests fail
- Full orchestration flow tests incomplete

## üêõ Known Issues

### 1. **Multi-fetch Granularity Bug** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Previous Issue**: LLM generated `"granularity": null` causing 400 errors
- **Solution**: Updated prompts to clarify:
  - For time grouping: Include valid granularity ("day", "week", "month", etc.)
  - For time filtering only: Omit granularity field entirely
  - Never use `"granularity": null`
- **Status**: All multi-fetch tests now passing

### 2. **Test Infrastructure**
- Tests take too long (49s for one test file)
- Some tests timeout after 2 minutes
- Docker test runner could be optimized

### 3. **Documentation Misalignment**
- README shows features as complete that aren't
- Architecture docs show unimplemented patterns
- TODO.md has outdated status markers

## üìà Production Readiness Assessment

### TicketingDataCapability: 69.2% Ready
**Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Core functionality complete
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully
- ‚úÖ Memory-aware query generation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage

**Missing for 100%**:
- ‚ùå Schema caching (fetches every request)
- ‚ùå Retry logic for transient failures
- ‚ùå Rate limiting protection
- ‚ùå Query result caching
- ‚ùå Structured monitoring/metrics

### Overall System: ~40% Ready
**Working**:
- Core data retrieval
- Entity resolution
- Basic Docker setup

**Not Working**:
- Complete orchestration flow
- Event analysis
- Chat support
- Memory learning

## üéØ Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Multi-fetch Bug**: Update prompt to handle granularity properly
2. **Complete EventAnalysisCapability**: Implement ID-based filtering
3. **Test Orchestration**: Get full workflow running with real data
4. **Update Documentation**: Align all docs with actual state

## üí° Recommendations

### For Development
1. Focus on getting EventAnalysisCapability working first
2. Fix the multi-fetch granularity issue
3. Complete orchestration integration
4. Then move to production improvements

### For Testing
1. Use Docker for all tests (more reliable)
2. Focus on integration tests with real data
3. Skip mock-based tests entirely
4. Add timeouts to prevent hanging

### For Documentation
1. Update README to show actual state
2. Mark aspirational features clearly
3. Add troubleshooting guide
4. Create migration plan from current to target state

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Fix multi-fetch granularity bug
   - Update documentation to reflect reality
   
2. **Short-term** (This Week):
   - Complete EventAnalysisCapability
   - Test full orchestration flow
   - Fix critical test failures

3. **Medium-term** (Next Sprint):
   - Add production improvements (caching, retry, monitoring)
   - Complete memory service features
   - Optimize test performance

This document reflects the honest current state. The foundation is solid, but significant work remains to achieve the full vision described in the original documentation.
